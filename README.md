# Fashion Forward Forecasting

## Project Overview
This project builds a machine learning pipeline to predict whether a customer would recommend a product based on review text, customer age, and product category information.

The model combines text processing with spaCy, TF-IDF feature extraction, and structured data preprocessing using scikit-learn pipelines.
